MOOPH
=====

MOOPH stands for Module for Object Oriented Pseudomultithreaded Hypertext. 

Pseudomultithreading is a workaround for absence of crossplatform crossbrowser multithreading (parallel processing) 
with access to DOM in javascript. 

I am publishing about my progress in this area on http://pseudomultithreading.webzdarma.cz now.
